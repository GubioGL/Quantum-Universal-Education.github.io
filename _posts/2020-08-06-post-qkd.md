This was adapted from a poster presented by Lia Yeh at the 2017 Research and Creative Activities Conference at the College of Creative Studies, the University of California, Santa Barbara.  That was a presentation of roughly the first half of her independent study on quantum key distribution, supervised by Dr. Carlos Lugo, while at the University of Cambridge via the Pembroke-King's Programme in summer 2017.
