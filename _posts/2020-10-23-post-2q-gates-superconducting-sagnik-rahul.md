Title: Commonly implemented two qubit gates for superconducting qubits

Abstract:

Among all quantum information processing architectures available, superconducting qubits has been a promising field of research. Designing high fidelity quantum gates, and implementing them to build practical quantum architectures is a key to build the computational infrastructure required to realize complex quantum algorithms. In this talk, we discuss some commonly implemented two-qubit gates to perform simple quantum information processing operations like quantum information swapping, applying a controlled phase, cross resonance etc. The broad classification of quantum gates, viz, flux tunable and microwave gates has been explained in elaborate detail. Understanding the physics of these commonly implemented two qubit gates is very crucial to realize feasible quantum information processing architectures.

Although this talk is intended to those having some basic knowledge of superconducting qubits and their associated physics, it can be a nice exposure even to perfect newbies in this domain. However, some idea of Quantum Mechanics is essentially required to grasp the rich physics of this field. Nevertheless, we hope that our contribution will serve as a good resource to understanding some commonly implemented two qubit gates :)
