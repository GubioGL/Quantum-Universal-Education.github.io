This introduction to quantum computing workshop video was made for [Clemson University's freshman hackathon](https://cuhack.it/)!  It teaches the topics of:
  - what is quantum computing
  - what is a qubit (extending the Schrödinger's cat analogy for quantum measurement)
  - quantum gates (X, H, CX)
  - quantum superposition
  - quantum entanglement
  - the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm (applied to a toy scenario of cat resurrection), run on the IBM Quantum Experience
  - via [a jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H5dFJ00q76oNlUZecy-8tWoFZRms51KM?usp=sharing): Qiskit installation, code example with each step explained, and how to run on real quantum devices

It also discusses the present and future of the field of quantum computing, the many fields to which quantum computation can be applied to, and guidance for learning more about quantum computing.
